# Weather-app

When I enter a city name, Today's forcast will display inside the "weatherInfo" div.

It will also add the city name to a list directly below it in the "list-group" div.

And, it will display the forecast for the next five days in a "weatherCard" div, which will be
placed inside the "cardHolder" div

still having issues getting the weather cards to display, whenever I try it, the console says
that the value "0" in my for loop is undefined (not sure why).

Also still having issues getting the weather to display when I click on an item from the list group.
